## CsGo: Constraint systems with Go

This is the main source code repository for CsGo. It contains the compiler
and documentation.

The CsGo language augments the normal syntax of the Go programming language to
enable easy declaration of polynomial constraint systems using Go programs. For 
more information see the
[introduction](https://github.com/aybehrouz/csgo/blob/main/docs/intro.md).
