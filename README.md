## CsGo: Constraint systems with Go

This is the main source code repository for CsGo. It contains the compiler
and [documentation]().

The CsGo language augments the normal syntax of the Go programming language to
enable easy declaration of constraint systems using Go programs. For more
information see the
[tutorial](https://github.com/aybehrouz/csgo/blob/fe2bb3d2a046240680d92d57a45a90e6ca7fcc6a/docs/intro.md).
